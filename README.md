## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide our client with data that will support a proposal to investors to invest in a bike-sharing program for the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Using a data set of a similar bike-share program in New York City we were able to create visualizations that will breakdown bike usage by user type, gender, and time values. 

## Results
A summary of our key visualizations are shown below:

![August Peak Hours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526199-7a84066d-05c2-48c7-974c-04ad7695cc67.PNG)
Based on the number of bikes in use we can determine the busiest times are 8AM and 5-6PM as these correspond with commutes.

![Checkout Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526204-7b9d9ade-7e2b-43c6-afa2-923f809eafb9.PNG)
Based on this graph we see that the most common travel duration is 5 minutes and bike usage tapers down the longer the trips grow.

![Checkouts Times by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526206-e73b95af-c838-4d30-8337-9bc842651bf3.PNG)
Similar to our previous graph, we are now able to see trip duration based on gender. We see that "Male" Users make up a majority of the user pool.

![Top Starting Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526213-8aee5f23-6913-4b9a-9d9b-b324bbd8bd5e.PNG)
Based on this map we can see that Manhattan is the most popular place to begin a trip. This could be due to the many companies headquartered here.

![Trips by Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526234-9fee23e9-74a0-4b98-9fac-8ae124a562a6.PNG)
Based on this heat map we can determine that bike sharing is most popular during weekday commute times. When compared to weekend demand, we can make the assertion that most of our users are commuters rather than tourists. 

![Trips by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526231-f08a1b6e-c101-41fc-bec2-a8aac85e0350.PNG)
When we breakdown the previous map by gender, we can see that the same demand holds true for both "Female" and "Male" users.

![User Trips by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106921601/190526237-bad92b34-6254-460d-b9ce-18d3cfa653e1.PNG)
This heat map shows us that a majority of our bike trips come from "Female" and "Male" subscribers.

## Summary

Based off the analysis of our key visuals we can determine that males make up a large portion of our user pool, and not only that but a majority of bike usage takes place during morning and afternoon commute times. Our data also suggest that the majority of our bike usage comes from subsribed daily commuters. When we compare this with our most common trip duration of 5 minutes, it is safe to assume that most of our users live close to their place of work. This supports our advocacy for a bike program in Des Moines as most of the intended user base will be commuters that will be traversing a short distance to work.  An additional visualization that could aid our proposal to investors is to compare revenue between normal customers and subscribers. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to also analyze data for an entire year to determine what impacts seasonal changes have on bike usage.

We should look further into start and end location to determine.
